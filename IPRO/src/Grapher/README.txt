This is a small piece of software written for the simple purpose of seeing the data we gathered from our testing session.
It expects a text file as an argument. It then reads that file and generates images of four graphs and one Google map.

The class DataGrapher2 does the same interpretation of the data, but instead of saving the images, it displays the graphs on the
screen using "simulated" time so that the data will be displayed at the same rate that it was recorded. This was mostly made to
use in the IPRO video deliverable.
